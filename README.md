# Subdomain-Savvy RAG: Enabling ROS2 Developers with Targeted Navigation Support


## Overview
Subdomain-Savvy RAG is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed to assist ROS2 developers by providing targeted navigation support. The system enhances the development experience by integrating domain-specific knowledge retrieval with generative AI capabilities, ensuring developers receive accurate, context-aware responses to their queries.

## Features
* Context-Aware Retrieval: Uses a vector search mechanism to fetch relevant ROS2 documentation and resources based on developer queries.
* Generative AI Integration: Combines retrieved information with LLM-based reasoning to generate precise and helpful responses.
* Subdomain Specialization: Adapts to different ROS2 subdomains (e.g., navigation, perception, control) for improved query relevance.

## Use Case
This tool is ideal for ROS2 developers seeking quick, accurate, and structured answers to their questions without sifting through extensive documentation. It helps streamline development by reducing search time and improving the accuracy of retrieved information.
