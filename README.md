# Finetuned RAG system


## CS-GY 6613 Fall 2024

This repository contains the code for the final project for the course Artificial Intelligence(CS-GY 6613).

The demo/outputs of the various milestones of the project are presented in the **milestone_outputs.ipynb** file.

### Note
- Due to rate limitations while creating an instruction dataset (screenshots are added), we reduced that dataset to only include 1 repository and 5 youtube videos for each domain.
- All the screenshots are of before cutting the size of the dataset.
